## Introduction

- **Challenge:**
    - Securing OT systems is difficult.
    - Honeypots is a tool, but requires competence and individualization.
- **Goal:**
    - The deployment model is automatable, but still effective.
    - A step on the road towards Honeypot-as-a-service.
- **Proposed Solution:** Design a deployment model where automation is possible.

## Current State of the Art

- Tverrå (2023)
- Continuous Determination
- Scaled Manhattan Distance
- 87% accuracy
- Avg. # of keystrokes: 825

---

## Methodology

- **Continuous analysis of keystrokes**
- Statistical methods
- Trust Model
- Authentication & Identification

---

## Further Improvements and Work

- Outlier removal
    - Repeat in several iterations
    - Perform different types
- Feature selection
    - Test for more/less influencing features
