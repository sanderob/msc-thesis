## Introduction

- **Challenge:**
    - Securing OT systems is difficult.
    - Honeypots is a tool, but requires competence and individualization.
- **Goal:**
    - The deployment model is automatable, but still effective.
    - A step on the road towards Honeypot-as-a-service.
- **Proposed Solution:** Design a deployment model where automation is possible.

## Related Works

- Honeypots are a well-known tool
    - Used for research, detection, and prevention
    - Many different types of honeypots
- Wide research on the effectivness and use-cases

---

## Related Works (2)

- Honeypot-as-a-service is not widespread
    - Individualization, competence, manual deployment
- YAKSHA project (2020)
    - EU wide cooperation
    - Pilot project
    - No evidence of further work

## Related Works (3)

- Jafarian and Niakanlahiji (2020)
    - Model for planning honeypot deployment is proposed
    - Focus on the choice of honeypots and effectiveness
    - Includes planning phase

---

## Methodology

- Three main phases
    - Literature Review
    - Case Study
    - Proof of Concept

---

## Literature Review

- Preliminary research
- Acquire background knowledge
- identify related works
- Identify research gaps

---

## Case Study

- Theoretical exploration of practical use cases
- Look into Eidsiva Bredbånd's OT customer networks
- Identify and develop deployment strategies
- Makes up the foundation of the PoC

---

## Proof of Concept

- Implementation of a practical example
- Makes up the thesis results
- Proves fesibility
- Improves insight for further research

---

## Proof of Concept (2)

- Collaboration with Fortinet
    - Fortinet FortiDeceptor have been used
- Infrastructure as Code
    - Terraform
    - Microsoft Azure
- CI/CD and Version Control
    - GitHub
    - GitHub Actions

---

## Results

- The case study has resulted in a proposed model
- The PoC has proven the feasibility of the model
- A contribution is identified and a gap is decreased
- A step on the way to an automated honeypot-as-a-service product

---

## Future Work

- This is just a step on the way
- Preliminary research for the purpose of feasibility
- The complete gap is yet to be closed
