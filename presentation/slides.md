## Introduction

- **Challenge:**
    - Securing OT systems is difficult.
    - Honeypots is a tool, but requires competence and individualization.
- **Goal:**
    - The deployment model is automatable, but still effective.
    - A step on the road towards Honeypot-as-a-service.
- **Proposed Solution:** Design a deployment model where automation is possible.
